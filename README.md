# OpenML: ML from Scratch

A comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms and classifiers implemented from scratch in Python. This repository is designed to be highly customizable, educational, and experimental, allowing you to understand the inner workings of ML algorithms and modify them to meet your specific needs.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a toolkit for implementing algorithms from scratch, experimenting with modifications to existing algorithms, and building custom solutions tailored to specific problems. We encourage
- **Students and practitioners to develop for educational purposes**
- **Researchers to develop new ML techniques**
