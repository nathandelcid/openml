# Logistic Regression (NumPy)

A logistic regression classifier implemented from scratch with NumPy. This project is for experimentation.

## Current state
- `log_reg.py` defines a `LogisticRegression` class with:
  - Learning rate (`eta`) and L2 penalty (`alpha`)
  - Helper to prepend a bias column (`append_ones`)
  - Linear scoring helper (`score`)
- Training (`fit`) and prediction methods will be added next

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
